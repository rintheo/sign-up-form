# sign-up-form
A sign-up form for an imaginary service.
[View Demo](https://rintheo.github.io/sign-up-form/)

## Features
- All input except phone number is required
- JavaScript function to check if passwords inputted match
- An input will only display CSS styles for invalid input after being clicked once  
- Password will only accept a minimum of 8 characters without any specific requirements

## To implement
- Responsiveness on mobile
- Improve email validation. Right now accepts email without a top level domain (e.g. a@a is valid)
- Apply additional requirements for password input such as needing at least 1 uppercase character, 1 number and 1 symbol.
- Possibly clean/refactor the code in the future after learning more
